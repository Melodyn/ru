Mounting NTFS formatted drives on OSX has always been a pain, and I seem to forget how to get it to work every time. Here's the instructions for my future self when I'm tearing my hair out trying to make this work.

NTFS-3G is an open source implementation of NTFS and is available via homebrew. To install:

{% highlight bash %}
brew install ntfs-3g
sudo mv /sbin/mount_ntfs /sbin/mount_ntfs.orig
sudo ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/ntfs-3g/2014.2.15/sbin/mount_ntfs /sbin/mount_ntfs
{% endhighlight %}

The osxfuse file system bundle needs to be installed by the root user. (These instructions can be found by `brew info osxfuse`.)

{% highlight bash %}
sudo /bin/cp -RfX /usr/local/opt/osxfuse/Library/Filesystems/osxfusefs.fs /Library/Filesystems/
sudo chmod +s /Library/Filesystems/osxfusefs.fs/Support/load_osxfusefs
{% endhighlight %}

And that's it!
