Hi, I'm Nithin. I [write code](http://github.com/nithinbekal) for a living and am currently building [CrowdStudio.in](https://crowdstudio.in/) from Kochi, India. You can find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nithinbekal) and [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1059476-nithin-bekal). I use Ruby as my primary programming language and help organize the Kochi Ruby meetups.
