- [Can being African make you bad at design? â€” Cultural bias in design](https://interaction18.ixda.org/program/talk-can-being-african-make-you-a-bad-designer----cultural-bias-in-design-madzima-farai/) -
  Fantastic talk about how cultural differences affect
  the way you communicate and work in teams.
  As an immigrant who recently joined a culturally diverse team,
  this was a good reminder to be more aware of these unconscious biases.
