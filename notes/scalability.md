  - **Pull on demand** -
    "To find out if one of your friends has added a new favorite band Facebook
    actually queries all your friends to find what's new. They can get away
    with this but because of their awesome infrastructure."
    - Difficult when there are lots of followers. FB has a 5000 friend limit.
  - **Push on change** - when user makes a change, it is pushed out to all followers.
    - changes are stored in each user's account
    - works better for large number of followers, eg. Twitter, Digg.
