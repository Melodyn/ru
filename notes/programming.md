### Misc notes

Software design principles**

- [Venkat Subramaniam - Core Software Design Principles](https://vimeo.com/97541185)
  - Provides vocabulary for communicating intent
  - Help build better quality software

**DRY**

"Every piece of knowledge in a system must have
a single authoritative, aunambiguous representation."

- Don't repeat yourself
- First introduced in Pragmatic Programmer book

**YAGNI**

- You Ain't Gonna Need It (yet)
- Postpone decisions until you understand the problem better

**Single level of abstraction (SLAP) principle**

- Each method should have a single level of abstraction
- aka. Compose method pattern

**Tell, Don't Ask**

- Tell your code to do something, don't ask it for internal state
- Avoid low level details
